  abstract     = {Untethered synthetic microrobots have significant potential to revolutionize minimally invasive medical interventions in the future. However, their relatively slow speed and low controllability near surfaces typically are some of the barriers standing in the way of their medical applications. Here, we introduce acoustically powered microrobots with a fast, unidirectional surface-slipping locomotion on both flat and curved surfaces. The proposed three-dimensionally printed, bullet-shaped microrobot contains a spherical air bubble trapped inside its internal body cavity, where the bubble is resonated using acoustic waves. The net fluidic flow due to the bubble oscillation orients the microrobot's axisymmetric axis perpendicular to the wall and then propels it laterally at very high speeds (up to 90 body lengths per second with a body length of 25 µm) while inducing an attractive force toward the wall. To achieve unidirectional locomotion, a small fin is added to the microrobot’s cylindrical body surface, which biases the propulsion direction. For motion direction control, the microrobots are coated anisotropically with a soft magnetic nanofilm layer, allowing steering under a uniform magnetic field. Finally, surface locomotion capability of the microrobots is demonstrated inside a three-dimensional circular cross-sectional microchannel under acoustic actuation. Overall, the combination of acoustic powering and magnetic steering can be effectively utilized to actuate and navigate these microrobots in confined and hard-to-reach body location areas in a minimally invasive fashion.},

  abstract     = {Significance             Controlled microrobotic navigation in blood vessels holds significant potential to revolutionize targeted drug delivery. Navigation on the surface of the blood vessels is advantageous because of decreased flow velocities; however, surface microtopography of blood vessels, in the size scale of the microrobots, is a major hurdle for robust locomotion of surface-rolling microrobots against the blood flow. Here, we show the effect of the body-shape anisotropy of the microrollers on their locomotion capability over vessel-like microtopographies. We demonstrate by experiments and simulations that the microrollers with slender bodies are more robust to locomote on biological microtopographies due to their favorable hydrodynamic interactions. Thus, such anisotropically shaped microrollers would be more viable and robust in future in vivo medical applications.           ,              Surface microrollers are promising microrobotic systems for controlled navigation in the circulatory system thanks to their fast speeds and decreased flow velocities at the vessel walls. While surface propulsion on the vessel walls helps minimize the effect of strong fluidic forces, three-dimensional (3D) surface microtopography, comparable to the size scale of a microrobot, due to cellular morphology and organization emerges as a major challenge. Here, we show that microroller shape anisotropy determines the surface locomotion capability of microrollers on vessel-like 3D surface microtopographies against physiological flow conditions. The isotropic (single, 8.5 µm diameter spherical particle) and anisotropic (doublet, two 4 µm diameter spherical particle chain) magnetic microrollers generated similar translational velocities on flat surfaces, whereas the isotropic microrollers failed to translate on most of the 3D-printed vessel-like microtopographies. The computational fluid dynamics analyses revealed larger flow fields generated around isotropic microrollers causing larger resistive forces near the microtopographies, in comparison to anisotropic microrollers, and impairing their translation. The superior surface-rolling capability of the anisotropic doublet microrollers on microtopographical surfaces against the fluid flow was further validated in a vessel-on-a-chip system mimicking microvasculature. The findings reported here establish the design principles of surface microrollers for robust locomotion on vessel walls against physiological flows.},

  abstract     = {Biological microorganisms overcome the Brownian motion at low Reynolds numbers by utilizing symmetry-breaking mechanisms. Inspired by them, various microrobot locomotion methods have been developed at the microscale by breaking the hydrodynamic symmetry. Although the boundary effects have been extensively studied for microswimmers and employed for surface-rolling microrobots, the behavior of microrobots in the proximity of multiple wall-based “confinement” is yet to be elucidated. Here, we study the confinement effect on the motion of surface-rolling microrobots. Our experiments demonstrate that the locomotion efficiency of spherical microrollers drastically decreases in confined spaces due to out-of-plane rotational flows generated during locomotion. Hence, a slender microroller design, generating smaller rotational flows, is shown to outperform spherical microrollers in confined spaces. Our results elucidate the underlying physics of surface rolling-based locomotion in confined spaces and present a design strategy with optimal flow generation for efficient propulsion in such areas, including blood vessels and microchannels.},

The optimal soft actuators need to be fast and forceful and have programmable shape changes. Furthermore, they should be energy efficient for untethered applications and easy to fabricate. Here, we combine desirable characteristics from two distinct active material systems: fast and highly efficient actuation from dielectric elastomers and directed shape programmability from liquid crystal elastomers. Via a top-down photoalignment method, we program molecular alignment and localized giant elastic anisotropy into the liquid crystal elastomers. The linearly actuated liquid crystal elastomer monoliths achieve strain rates over 120\% per second with an energy conversion efficiency of 20\% while moving loads over 700 times the elastomer weight. The electric actuation mechanism offers unprecedented opportunities toward miniaturization with shape programmability, efficiency, and more degrees of freedom for applications in soft robotics and beyond.},

Especially micro/nanofibrillar structures on gecko toes can have strong and controllable adhesion and shear on a wide range of surfaces with residual-free, repeatable, self-cleaning, and other unique features. Synthetic dry fibrillar adhesives inspired by such biological fibrils are optimized in different aspects to increase their performance. Previous fibril designs for shear optimization are limited by predefined standard shapes in a narrow range primarily based on human intuition, which restricts their maximum performance. This study combines the machine learning-based optimization and finite-element-method-based shear mechanics simulations to find shear-optimized fibril designs automatically. In addition, fabrication limitations are integrated into the simulations to have more experimentally relevant results. The computationally discovered shear-optimized structures are fabricated, experimentally validated, and compared with the simulations. The results show that the computed shear-optimized fibrils perform better than the predefined standard fibril designs. This design optimization method can be used in future real-world shear-based gripping or nonslip surface applications, such as robotic pick-and-place grippers, climbing robots, gloves, electronic devices, and medical and wearable devices.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal piezoelectric energy harvesting can be achieved by integrating piezo-patch harvesters into plate-like structures available in marine, aerospace, and automotive applications. A synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI) interface as the harvesting circuit has been well studied for cantilever beams, considering the single vibration mode of the structure. However, integrating a two-dimensional electromechanical structure with a SSHI circuit for multimodal energy harvesting is missing in the literature. This paper evaluates the performance of the SSHI interface integrated with a piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) on a plate-like host structure. The analytical solution is developed based on an equivalent impedance approach to predict the steady-state electrical response of the harvester as a closed-form solution. The experiments are conducted to validate the analytical solution for the system’s first and second vibration modes. The experimental results reveal that integration of SSHI to a plate-like harvester introduces a multi-switching behavior rather than a standard single-switching behavior. Due to the multimodal vibrational characteristics of the plate, the circuit switch is triggered several times at each half period of the vibration, which increases the energy dissipation of the circuit and thus reduces the output voltage. On the other hand, single switching at each half period of the vibration happens for lower piezoelectric voltage levels. This is the desired behavior of the SSHI circuit where the analytical prediction matches with the experimental data. Finally, the energy harvesting performance of the SSHI circuit is compared against the standard rectifier, showing 183\% and 134\% power output enhancement for the first and second vibration modes, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Heart failure (HF) rates elevate worldwide with the aging population. Miniaturized and wireless implants with real-time data transfer capability can alleviate the surgical complexities of cardiac pressure monitoring. Despite recent developments of mm-size implants with complex circuitries and self-powering units, a simple, passive, and effective implant design for the real-time pressure reading is missing. Here, the piezo capsule, a simple, cost-effective, and miniaturized passive ultrasound pressure sensing system, is introduced. The capsule design consists of a 1 mm-cube-sized lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducer and a T-shaped mechanical pin. The impedance changes of an interrogating ultrasound probe, which is ultrasonically coupled to the receiver implant, correlate to the electrical/mechanical loading of the piezo capsule. The ultrasonic sensing properties of the proposed device are characterized across a hard-solid medium (e.g., plexiglass) and soft tissue-like media (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and chicken breast tissue) and verified the impedance changes using finite element simulations. Last, dynamic wireless pressure readings of an artificial vessel for varying fluid flow pulse-frequency and volumetric rate are demonstrated. The sensitivity of 0.375 Ω kPa−1 is achieved as the pressure changed from 14 to 86 kPa and pulse frequency from 0 to 100 bpm with a fixed flow rate of 8 mL min−1.},

  abstract     = {Stimuli-responsive hydrogels have garnered significant attention as a versatile class of soft actuators. Introducing anisotropic properties, and shape-change programmability to responsive hydrogels promises a host of opportunities in the development of soft robots. Herein we report the synthesis of pH-responsive hydrogel nanocomposites with predetermined microstructural anisotropy, shape-transformation, and self-healing. Our hydrogel nanocomposites are largely composed of zwitterionic monomers and asymmetric cellulose nanocrystals. While the zwitterionic nature of the network imparts both self-healing and cytocompatibility to our hydrogel nanocomposites, the shear-induced alignment of cellulose nanocrystals renders their anisotropic swelling and mechanical properties. Thanks to the self-healing properties, we utilized a cut-and-paste approach to program reversible, and complex deformation into our hydrogels. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated the transport of light cargo using tethered and untethered soft robots made from our hydrogels. We believe the proposed material system introduce a powerful toolbox for the development of future generations of biomedical soft robots.},

  abstract     = {Soft-bodied aquatic invertebrates, such as sea slugs and snails, are capable of diverse locomotion modes under water. Recapitulation of such multimodal aquatic locomotion in small-scale soft robots is challenging, due to difficulties in precise spatiotemporal control of deformations and inefficient underwater actuation of existing stimuli-responsive materials. Solving this challenge and devising efficient untethered manipulation of soft stimuli-responsive materials in the aquatic environment would significantly broaden their application potential in biomedical devices. We mimic locomotion modes common to sea invertebrates using monolithic liquid crystal gels (LCGs) with inherent light responsiveness and molecular anisotropy. We elicit diverse underwater locomotion modes, such as crawling, walking, jumping, and swimming, by local deformations induced by selective spatiotemporal light illumination. Our results underpin the pivotal role of the physicomechanical properties of LCGs in the realization of diverse modes of light-driven robotic underwater locomotion. We envisage that our results will introduce a toolbox for designing efficient untethered soft robots for fluidic environments.},

  abstract     = {While micromachines with tailored functionalities enable therapeutic applications in biological environments, their controlled motion and targeted drug delivery in biological media require sophisticated designs for practical applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a new generation of crystalline and nanoporous polymers, offer new perspectives for light-driven microswimmers in heterogeneous biological environments including intraocular fluids, thus setting the stage for biomedical applications such as retinal drug delivery. Two different types of COFs, uniformly spherical TABP-PDA-COF sub-micrometer particles and texturally nanoporous, micrometer-sized TpAzo-COF particles are described and compared as light-driven microrobots. They can be used as highly efficient visible-light-driven drug carriers in aqueous ionic and cellular media. Their absorption ranging down to red light enables phototaxis even in deeper and viscous biological media, while the organic nature of COFs ensures their biocompatibility. Their inherently porous structures with ≈2.6 and ≈3.4 nm pores, and large surface areas allow for targeted and efficient drug loading even for insoluble drugs, which can be released on demand. Additionally, indocyanine green (ICG) dye loading in the pores enables photoacoustic imaging, optical coherence tomography, and hyperthermia in operando conditions. This real-time visualization of the drug-loaded COF microswimmers enables unique insights into the action of photoactive porous drug carriers for therapeutic applications.},

  abstract     = {Mobile microrobots hold remarkable potential to revolutionize health care by enabling unprecedented active medical interventions and theranostics, such as active cargo delivery and microsurgical manipulations in hard-to-reach body sites. High-resolution imaging and control of cell-sized microrobots in the in vivo vascular system remains an unsolved challenge toward their clinical use. To overcome this limitation, we propose noninvasive real-time detection and tracking of circulating microrobots using optoacoustic imaging. We devised cell-sized nickel-based spherical Janus magnetic microrobots whose near-infrared optoacoustic signature is enhanced via gold conjugation. The 5-, 10-, and 20-μm-diameter microrobots are detected volumetrically both in bloodless ex vivo tissues and under real-life conditions with a strongly light-absorbing blood background. We further demonstrate real-time three-dimensional tracking and magnetic manipulation of the microrobots circulating in murine cerebral vasculature, thus paving the way toward effective and safe operation of cell-sized microrobots in challenging and clinically relevant intravascular environments.           ,              Cell-sized magnetic microrobots are tracked in the murine cerebral vasculature with noninvasive optoacoustic imaging.},
