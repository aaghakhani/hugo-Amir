# PhD Positions Available in Microrobotic Biomedical Systems with Prof. Amirreza Aghakhani

## Research Summary

We engineer intelligent microrobots for biomedical applications in targeted drug delivery, microsurgery, detoxification, and diagnostics by advancing micro- and nanofabrication as well as ultrasound technologies. To realize their full potential, medical microrobots have to master locomotion in complex biofluidic environments, wireless actuation and control, precise imaging and localization, and effective drug/cargo delivery. We overcome these challenges by incorporating biologically inspired adaptive capabilities into microrobotic agents and utilize lab-on-a-chip and microfluidic systems to validate biological and therapeutic functions. We thus bridge the gap between biomedical research and clinical applications to propel medical microrobots to the forefront of modern healthcare.

## Applicant Profile

We are searching for exceptional Ph.D. candidates who possess:

- A strong research background in one of the following fields: Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Biophysics, Biology, and Materials Sciences.
- Enthusiasm for both simulation and experimental studies to drive innovation in Biomedical Systems.
- A fundamental knowledge of engineering principles to tackle real-world problems.
- Proficiency in coding, with experience in MATLAB or Python to develop computational models.
- Hands-on experimental skills and a desire to bring your ideas to life in the laboratory.

## What we offer

PhD candidates will receive a highly competitive salary and benefits, in alignment with the TV-L E13 scale. We provide access to cutting-edge research facilities and offer exceptional support for both your career and family needs. You will also have privileged access to an extensive network of research collaborators within the thriving CyberValley and Max Planck Society ecosystem.
