Our paper "[Piezo Capsule: Ultrasonic Way of Wireless Pressure Measurement](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aisy.202200125)” is published in Advanced Intellligent Systems. Here, we present the _piezo capsule_, a simple, cost-effective, and miniaturized passive ultrasound pressure sensing system. We demonstrated the real-time pressure profiles of an artificial vessel for varying fluid flow pulse frequency and volumetric rates.
