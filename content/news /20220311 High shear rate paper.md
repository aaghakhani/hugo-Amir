Our paper "High shear rate propulsion of acoustic microrobots in complex biological fluids‚Äù is published in [Science Advances](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abm5126). Here, we show how acoustically-powered microrobots can be efficiently propelled thorough complex viscoelastic fluids, such as blood and mucus, by the use of high shear rate fluidic flow near their body.
